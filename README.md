# Ticks

A box-ticking exercise for the busy, digital times. 

>It is one of several projects which could solve real problems and get used by real users, but their real objective is to help me learn [dart](https://dart.dev) and [flutter](https://flutter.dev). The other projects are: [flow](https://github.com/michalporeba/flow), [pataiu](https://github.com/michalporeba/pataiu) and [stuffed](https://github.com/michalporeba/stuffed).

## Problem domain

[Checklists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checklist) are very popular ways to reduce cognitive load, increase safety, compliance and reduce accidents. 

This simplest check list could be a to-do list. This will a more dynamic checklist, to help perform, and produce output from various checklists I have to do in my valunteering life. 

Additionally, it should integrate with all other three project mentioned above. The outcome of a checklist could be converted into a task in the [flow](https://github.com/michalporeba/flow), update inventory in [stuffed](https://github.com/michalporeba/stuffed) or help with compliance in [pataiu](https://github.com/michalporeba/pataiu).

* Interactions between multiple mobile apps.
